# Lip Syncing Project

This project focuses on lip syncing, using the Wav2Lip repository as a reference. Wav2Lip is a lip-syncing algorithm that generates realistic lip movements for a given speech input.

## Wav2Lip Repository

The core lip-syncing functionality of this project is built upon the [Wav2Lip](https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip) repository by Rudrabha Mukhopadhyay. Wav2Lip provides an implementation of the lip-syncing algorithm based on deep learning techniques.

Please refer to the Wav2Lip repository for detailed documentation, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Project Overview

The lip syncing project extends the capabilities of Wav2Lip by incorporating additional features, enhancements, and customizations specific to our requirements. The project aims to provide an improved lip-syncing experience and explore further applications of the technology.

### Features

- Advanced speech-to-lip synchronization
- Real-time lip movement generation
- Integration with video and audio processing libraries
- Customization options for lip shape and animation
- Support for different languages and speech accents
